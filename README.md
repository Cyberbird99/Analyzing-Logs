This script searches through a log file (provided by the user) and prints any lines that contain the 401 status code, which typically indicates that a request failed due to authentication issues. The output will display each line in the file that contains 401, making it useful for identifying failed login attempts or access issues in the logs.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

User Input:

The code prompts the user to enter the name of a log file using the input() function. This file is expected to be in the current working directory or a specific folder (in this case, the data folder).
python

Opening the Log File:

The code opens the file specified by the user in read mode ('r'). It uses the open() function to get a file object (f), which allows the code to read the content of the file line by line.


Reading the File Line by Line:

The code enters an infinite loop (while True) and reads each line from the file using f.readline().
If line is empty (meaning the end of the file is reached), it breaks the loop.

Searching for 401:

For each line in the log file, it checks if the string "401" is present. This is a simple search to find any line that contains the HTTP 401 status code, which indicates that the client request was rejected due to missing or invalid authentication credentials.

Closing the File:

After reading all the lines, the file is closed using f.close(), which is important to free up system resources.
